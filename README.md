**.axon** is a binary model-weight container and runtime loader for AI models. It helps
memory-limited machines — laptops, edge devices, home AI servers — load and run large
models more efficiently by using memory mapping, partial tensor access, and
SSD-backed caching.

## What Axon Does

- **Zero-copy tensor views via mmap** — `tensor_view()` returns a `&[u8]` slice
  directly into the memory-mapped file. No allocation, no copying. The OS pages
  in tensor data from disk on first access.
- **Fast model opening** — parse header + manifest + tensor index in ~30µs, regardless
  of file size
- **Partial tensor loading** — load only the rows or byte range you need
- **SSD-backed execution** — keep model weights on SSD, cache only active tensors in RAM
- **SSD-backed execution** — keep model weights on SSD, cache only active tensors in RAM
- **LoRA adapter side-loading** — fast adapter switching without loading full models
- **Tensor cache management** — LRU eviction, pinning, memory budget control
- **Sharded model support** — models split across multiple files

## What Axon Is Not

Axon does **not** accelerate neural network training compute. Training speed depends
on GPU compute, memory bandwidth, optimizer operations, and matrix multiplication.
Axon improves:

- Model loading and startup latency
- Memory usage through lazy mmap and partial access
- Tensor access through zero-copy views
- Runtime deployment through caching and patching
- Inference startup latency on memory-constrained hardware

The primary Axon value proposition:

> Axon provides safe, mmap-backed, low-memory, partial-access tensor loading for runtime inference workloads.

Target environments:

- Laptops
- Mini PCs
- Jetson and edge AI devices
- Raspberry Pi-class systems
- Local AI inference servers
- Memory-constrained deployments

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install via Rust
cargo build --release

# Create a test model with 17 tensors
./target/release/axon create --model "MyModel-7B" --architecture llama model.axon

# Inspect it
./target/release/axon inspect model.axon

# Open with the runtime (zero-copy mmap, no tensor data loaded)
./target/release/axon runtime open model.axon
```

```rust
use axon_runtime::AxonRuntime;

let rt = AxonRuntime::open("model.axon")?;

// Zero-copy view — no allocation, no copying, direct mmap slice
let view: &[u8] = rt.tensor_view("emb_weight")?;

// Shape-aware row slicing — maps only the requested rows
let rows: &[u8] = rt.tensor_rows("emb_weight", 0, 128)?;

// Owned copy (outlives the runtime)
let data: Vec<u8> = rt.tensor("emb_weight")?;
```

## Performance

Benchmarked on a ~100MB synthetic model (100 tensors, 1MB each):

| Operation | Time |
|---|---|
| Open (parse metadata) | **~29µs** |
| First tensor access | **~183ns** (offset math, OS handles page faults) |
| Sequential access (100 tensors) | **~498µs** |
| Partial load (4KB of 1MB tensor) | **~1.15µs** |
| Full load (1MB tensor) | **~144µs** |

**Key insight:** The runtime does not load tensor data during `open()`. Only the
header (64 bytes), manifest (a few KB), and tensor descriptors (192 bytes each) are
parsed. Individual tensor bytes are faulted in from disk by the OS on first access.

## Runtime Architecture

Axon has two layers:

| Crate | Purpose | Memory model |
|---|---|---|
| `core/` | Format library: parse, write, validate, convert | Loads into `Vec<u8>` (safe, simple) |
| `runtime/` | Execution layer: mmap, cache, partial load, LoRA | Borrows from mmap (zero-copy, lazy) |

The runtime is the recommended path for inference. The core format library is the
stable base used by the CLI, FFI, and Python bindings.

See **[docs/runtime-architecture.md](docs/runtime-architecture.md)** for the full design.
